Criminal Sketch Artist: Text-to-image Synthesis Using a Generative Adversarial Network
===================================

The role of a criminal sketch artist is to produce a rendering of a criminal
based on the spoken description offered by an eye witness.

Example 1 of a Criminal Sketch Arist Rendering:

Example 2 of a Criminal Sketch Arist Rendering:

This project's aim is to train a generative adversarial network to produce
renderings of human faces from a noise vector whose distribution is aligned
with the distribution of text descriptions provided during training.
